This is my personal neovim configuration I use on a daily basis.
I life my live in tmux and neovim, so consider this a personal moving target that gets updated on a regular basis.

Some configurations and util functions are copied and modified from the LazyVim distribution I used before
switching to my own config. Some parts are taken from kickstart.
